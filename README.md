## Code Examples

### Database Comparartor

During my work at MPI one of the tasks I was reponsible for was catching discrepancies between two data sets generated from the same source file. This was quite expensive and time consuming task which is why I decided to automate it.

- [README](SQLscript/README.md) describes how it works and neccessary steps to run it
- [main.py](SQLscript/main.py) source file in which you can review the code
- [Folder](https://github.com/Fatalwgx/LevZavodskov/tree/main/SQLscript) with the script and it's dependancies
