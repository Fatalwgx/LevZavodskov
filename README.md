## About
After graduating highschool and during my university years I was self-studying Python, didn't get much progress and decided to get a well structured Java developer course. During which I've been solving countless logical tasks, developing simple projects like encryptors and mini-games. Due to family issues had to stop the course half way through. In my spare time I've studied html/css and after a while decided to enroll into Software QA courses.
Shortly after the course I was employed at IT TEST tula as QA engineer and assigned to a foreign project at an American company "Markov Processes International". Currently I am looking for job opportunities outside of Russia with potential relocation options.

## Experience
- 15.08.2020 - 25.10.2021 - Unofficial 2 years of QA experience in an outsource company working for one of the biggest russian marketplaces

## Code Examples
### Database Comparartor
During my work at MPI one of the tasks I was reponsible for was catching discrepancies between two data sets generated from the same source file. This was quite expensive and time consuming task which is why I decided to automate it.

- [README](SQLscript/README.md) describes how it works and neccessary steps to run it
- [main.py](SQLscript/main.py) source file in which you can review the code
- [Folder](https://github.com/Fatalwgx/LevZavodskov/tree/main/SQLscript) with the script and it's dependencies
### Selenium webdriver, pytest tests
Tests written as the final task during automation testing course.

- [README](https://github.com/Fatalwgx/AutomationCourseFinalTask/blob/6d35d31050d12273f0ea3a3ec272b1a3c7d6f65d/README.md) explains how to run them on windows
