## About

After graduating highschool and during my university years I was self-studying Python, didn't get much progress and decided to get a well structured Java developer course. During which I've been solving countless logical tasks, developing simple projects like encryptors and mini-games. Due to family issues had to stop the course half way through. In my spare time I've studied html/css and after a while decided to enroll into Software QA courses.
Shortly after the course I was employed at IT TEST tula as QA engineer and assigned to a foreign project at an American company "Markov Processes International". Currently I am looking for job opportunities outside of Russia with potential relocation options.

## Code Examples

### Database Comparartor

During my work at MPI one of the tasks I was reponsible for was catching discrepancies between two data sets generated from the same source file. This was quite expensive and time consuming task which is why I decided to automate it.

- [README](SQLscript/README.md) describes how it works and neccessary steps to run it
- [main.py](SQLscript/main.py) source file in which you can review the code
- [Folder](https://github.com/Fatalwgx/LevZavodskov/tree/main/SQLscript) with the script and it's dependancies
